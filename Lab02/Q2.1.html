    //Q2
    /*Classes in JavaScript
    • Create a class named Vehicle using a function.
    • Add a property named type to the class (this.type). Assign a value to that variable
    using a constructor argument.
    • Add a function to its prototype named drive (Vehicle.prototype.print...). Print
    'Vehicle is driving’ in the function body.
    Add VehicleCount (Vehicle.VehicleCount) as a static variable.
    • Increase the number of VehicleCount (Vehicle.VehicleCount++) by one inside the
    constructor
    • Create an object from Vehicle class (new Vehicle) and check static variable value,type
    property value and function work.
    • Create a class named Car and extend the class Vehicle (Car.prototype =
    Object.create(Vehicle.prototype); Car.prototype.constructor = Car).
    • Add a new method called balanceWheels to Car and print ‘Wheels are balanced’ in
    the function body
    • Call balanceWheels and drive methods using a car object and verify the
    functionality.
    • Check the static variable value and type variable value. Notice that they are not
    correct.
    • The reason for the above behavior is that we didn’t call the parent constructor from
    the child class. Do this by using the call method (in Car constructor function
    Vehicle.call(this,type);)
    • Re-validate the values.*/
